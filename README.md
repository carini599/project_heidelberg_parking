## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

As part of my Nanodegree "Data Analyst" at Udacity. I investigated the parking situation of two parking garages in Heidelberg. The goal of the project was to prepare self chosen data by wrangling and cleaning and finally answering to a reseach question.
The City of Heidelberg in Germany collects data about the off-streetparking in their parking garages and provides them to the public on their data platform, accessible via the link: https://ckan.datenplattform.heidelberg.de/de/dataset/mobility_main_parking. 
The data is provided in CSV files or via an API in JSON-Format.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* Data_Wrangling_Project_Starter(5).ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code and charts along with some comments.
* parking_hist_data_p01_raw.csv: Raw Data for P1 from API, converted from json to csv.
* parking_hist_data_p07_raw.csv: Raw Data for P7 in csv.
